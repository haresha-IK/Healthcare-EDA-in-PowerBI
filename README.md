🏥 Healthcare EDA in Power BI

🔍 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset using Microsoft Power BI.
It aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about patients, doctors, hospitals, and billing behavior.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and analyze healthcare-related data

Find trends in billing, admissions, and medical conditions

Visualize patient demographics and hospital performance

Use Power BI DAX measures to calculate key performance metrics (KPIs)

📊 KPIs and DAX Measures
KPI	DAX Formula	
Total Billing Amount	SUM(Patient[Billing Amount])	Total revenue generated by hospitals
Average Billing Amount	AVERAGE(Patient[Billing Amount])	Average amount billed per patient
Total Patients	COUNT(Patient[Name])	Total number of patients
Average Stay Duration	AVERAGE(Patient[Stay Duration])	Average hospital stay length (in days)
📈 Visualizations & Insights

2. 🧑‍⚕️ Patients by Doctor

Chart Type: Column Chart

Insight: Dr. Michael Smith treated the most patients, followed by John Smith and David Smith.

3. 👩‍⚕️ Gender Distribution

Chart Type: Donut Chart

Insight: Female patients: 20,202, Male patients: 20,034 — nearly equal distribution.

4. 💰 Billing Amount by Month

Chart Type: Line Chart

Insight: Billing and patient counts peak during May, June, July, and August — possibly due to seasonal illness trends.

5. 🏥 Billing Amount by Hospital

Chart Type: Bar Chart

Insight: CityCare Hospital contributed the highest total billing.

6. 📅 Monthly Admissions Trend

Chart Type: Line Chart

Insight: Admissions gradually increased mid-year, showing higher patient inflow in summer months.

💡 Key Insights Summary

Total Billing Amount: 💵 1.03 Billion

Average Billing Amount: 💳 25.51K

Total Patients: 👥 14.24K

Average Stay Duration: ⏱️ 15 Days

Top Doctors: 🩺 Michael Smith > John Smith > David Smith

🧠 What is EDA?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) means exploring data to find hidden patterns, relationships, or anomalies before modeling or making decisions.
In this project, Power BI visualizations and DAX measures help identify trends in healthcare operations and patient care.

🛠️ Tools Used

Microsoft Power BI — Visualization and analysis

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) — Custom formulas and KPIs

Excel / CSV — Dataset format
